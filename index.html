		<h1>October 7, 2022</h1>
		
		<h2>Afternoon</h2>

		<p class="first">Today I bought tickets to see Phish at Madision Square Garden on New Year's Eve. I'm feeling a lot of things right now.
		
		<p>Last October 2021, my friend Geoff made a request towards the end of his struggle with cancer. He wanted his buddies to join him in Las Vegas to see his favorite band during their Halloween run. We did. It was beautiful. And it rekindled my love of the band, a love that started in the mid-90s.</p>

		<p>A few months later Geoff died. He didn’t make it to the next Phish NYE like he was hoping and we talked about. But I can make it and I will, for him and also for me.</p>

		<p>Seeing Phish at Madison Square Garden has been a dream since I started collecting tapes in 1995. I first saw the band in 1997 and dozens of times in the late 90s and early 2000s. Then I took a different direction in life, for 20 years. And if it wasn’t for dear Geoff, I probably would have kept live music on the periphery of my life.</p>

		<p>But there’s a wisdom in the clarity of a person staring death in the face, a wisdom in their priorities. Geoff was right and so I’m going to the Garden for New Year’s Eve.</p>

 		<p>I’m excited and somehow terrified. Terrified of not making the most of it. Terrified that I might not honor our departed buddy somehow. But mostly I’m so happy to live out a dream, a dream that Geoff asked me to live out.

		<h2>Night</h2>
		
		<p class="first">After all the planning and spending, the driving and flying, I make it to New York. The timing works out so well: I get to stay the night at Earle’s place in Bed-Stuy.

		<p>Earle was one of the first people I met when I arrived at the Buddhist center in 2004, the Buddhist center in very rural Arizona where I met Geoff and spent most of my 20s. Earle is also one of the people I still feel closest to from that chapter of my life.</p>


		<p>Earle was also tight with Geoff. The three of us, along with 9 or 10 others, all attended that Phish 2021 Halloween run in Vegas. That was at Geoff’s request. He wanted his Buddhism Buddies™ to join him in his “church”, knowing it could be his last time.</p>

		<p>That’s really how Geoff referred to Phish shows. They were religious experiences for him. And of that group in Vegas I was (and am) the only one who has long had that same spiritual connection with Phish concerts. So Geoff and I had a bond around that and I feel like his death made these shows even more meaningful for me. Maybe he inspired me, maybe he transferred some of his passion to me.</p>

		<h2>Morning</h2>
		
		<p class="first">The day of the show. Earle and I walk around Brooklyn. We drink proper coffee, eat, talk about old times and new times. It’s great. </p> 

		<p>Around 2pm I head to Manhattan. I check in to my hotel, just blocks from Madison Square Garden, tonight’s house of worship.</p>

		<p>I still can’t believe this is actually going to happen: attending Phish New Year’s at the Garden. This is something I’ve wanted to do since I was practically a child. I’ve seen many shows, some of them legendary in the Phish world. But never at the MSG. Never at “the spiritual home” of the band.</p>

		<h2>Evening</h2>
		
		<p class="first">I arrive and line up outside of MSG in a scene that does feel like a spiritual home. All the themed shirts, and conversations, and excitement just like I remember from 25 years ago. I grin like a big dummy standing alone in line.</p>

		<p>And eventually people start talking to me, one person or group then another. All night I’m meeting new people. 

		<p>Most people ask if I’m attending alone. I tell them yes and in some cases I tell them about my history and about Geoff. And all these people, we become friends, tight friends, bonded friends only for tonight. And it’s beautiful.

			Sam, an observant Jew wearing tallit katan, sits on my right. He’s here with his son, daughter, and each of their spouses. I wish him a <em>shavua tov</em>—a good week, as shabbat just ended—and we talk about Phish and fatherhood. A young couple is on my left. He started seeing Phish in 2014 and she is new to the scene. They constantly check in with me to see if I’m having fun. Dave and Teri are behind me, from Ventura. Harley is also back there. He’s from Solon, Ohio near where I grew up.  Harley first saw the Grateful Dead in 1972. He loves Phish so much, he had to come to New York. 

		<p>I sit in this synagogue, waiting for the show, looking around, trying to appreciate where I am and what I’m doing. Tonight is a night to stay in the moment, that’s very difficult for me but the adrenaline helps.

		<h2>Show Time</h2>

		<p class="first">The lights go down. The crowd roars. The band takes the stage. It's really happening.

		<p>Four guys, just humans, mere mortals, but between these four, their hardworking team, and the fans we’re always able to create something transcendent… for me, at least.

			The music starts at 8:05pm and it goes until 1:09am. It’s everything I wanted and more. Especially the song <i>Drift While You’re Sleeping</i>. 

		<p>This was one of Geoff’s favorite songs, and it’s a very Geoff song. He was an old-school Phish fan, east coast gen x; started seeing them in the mid-1990s. And yet he loved Phish’s newer songs, which is kind of rare amongst the seasoned older crew.</p>

		<p>The song is about the brevity of life and the power of love. Corny shit and Geoff loved it. <i>Drift</i> may have been his highlight of the last Phish show he ever saw. And thankfully we have video of that.</p>

		<span class="caption">2021, Halloween: Geoff at his last show, ecastatic about <i>Drift While You're Sleeping</i></span>

		<p>I cry hard during this song. It feels like the goodbye that I think I came here for. “We move through stormy weather; We know that are days are few. We dream and we struggle together; But love will carry us through.”

		<p>So heavy-handed. So sappy. So “new Phish”. And so powerful for those who have ears to hear it. The older I get the softer I get and that’s much better than the alternative. 

		<p>The New Year’s Eve “gag” is bizarre and amazing and very appropriate. The theme is that 2023 is the band’s 40th anniversary. They blow out a birthday candle and wish that “we could do it all again”.

		<p>And they do. Every New Year’s gag the band has ever done starting in 1992 makes a reappearance during a wild medley that includes original songs and covers like <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and <i>Jungle Boogie</i>. 

		<p>There are dozens of dancers, aerial ballerinas, people in animal costumes. There’s a Tom Hanks Castaway character on a platform dangling above the stage during the song <i>Wilson</i>. A local choir and then a marching band make appearances. It’s chaos and everyone is jubilant. Green confetti rains down on all of us. The entire gag can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiAO_qpzrmI" target="_blank">seen here</a>.

		</a>

		<p>I never want it to stop. But it does. After the encore I sit and watch people shuffle out. I’m in no rush and I want to appreciate what I just experienced, to imprint the memories. 

		<p>I say goodbye and Happy New Year to Sam and his family, to Teri and Dave, to Harley, to the young couple that adopted me. 

		<p>I FaceTime my wife and 5-year old daughter from the empty arena. It’s not yet 2023 where they are. I want to see them and tell them I love them. I’m a very lucky person. It’s too much to think about sometimes. Most times, actually. I think about Geoff’s 4-year old son who lost his father just months ago. I hope he grows up with some memory of his dad.

		<h1>January 1, 2023</h1>

		<h2>Morning</h2>

		<p class="first">I did it. I made it happen. I did it for me. I did it for Geoff. 

		<p>I sit on the plane back to Portland. Back to daily life. Back home. I listen to the music from last night’s show. I slept for 2 hours and I’m exhausted. And I’m refreshed and high on my pilgrimage. Gratitude, that’s probably the right word. That’s the drug I’m on today. Gratitude and caffeine, I guess.

		<p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to travel. Grateful that Phish is still playing and playing well. Grateful for my family’s support. Grateful for Geoff, knowing that beautiful man, who was one of the most kind and gentle people I’ve ever known. He just wanted everyone to be happy. He loved his friends; he wanted to know they were smiling. Geoff made this happen for me. Even after death, our buddy brought joy to his friends. Love carries him through.
